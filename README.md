# csv_merge_program

Project includes code for a graphical user interface which allows the user to combine the data from two specific CSV files into one file containing all desired data. It should be noted this program was created for very specifically formatted CSV files which were only meant to be combined in one way (for use at Timesheet Mobile customer service).
